Keep Calm Volleyball - part of the Keep Calm and Carry On community for English speakers in Barcelona.

Beach volleyball at Barcelona's beaches! We play year-round with regular Saturday sessions and ad-hoc games throughout the week. Anyone can post a game - just say where and when and see who's in.

Regular Saturdays: 14:00-18:00 at the beach. Net and balls provided.

All levels welcome. We rotate teams so everyone gets to play.

Cost: Free! We use public beach nets.

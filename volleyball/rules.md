# Keep Calm Volleyball - Group Rules

Welcome to Keep Calm Volleyball! To keep things fun and fair for everyone, please follow these guidelines.

> These rules apply on top of our general WhatsApp rules:
> https://github.com/keepcalmbcn/keepcalm/blob/main/keep-calm/rules/whatsapp-rules.md

## 1. Language

English is our primary language in the chat. It's the most inclusive option when we have members from 30+ nationalities and easiest for us to moderate. Feel free to speak whatever you like on the beach!

## 2. Attendance

- If you say you're coming, make the effort to show up
- If your plans change, let the group know so others can take your spot
- For organised sessions with limited spots, dropping out last minute lets people down

## 3. Equipment

- Look after shared equipment (net, balls) - the organiser brings these for everyone
- Help set up and pack down, don't leave it all to one person
- If you have your own ball, feel free to bring it along

## 4. Fair Play

- Rotate teams regularly so everyone gets to play
- Mix up skill levels across teams
- Be patient with beginners and help them learn
- Keep it friendly - this is a social game, not a tournament

## 5. Beach Etiquette

- Respect other beach users and their space
- Take your rubbish with you when you leave
- Keep noise levels reasonable
- Look after the public nets we use

## 6. Safety

- Stay hydrated, especially in summer
- Wear sunscreen - Barcelona sun is no joke
- Warm up before playing to avoid injuries
- If you're feeling unwell, sit one out

## 7. Be Sound

- Welcome newcomers and get them involved
- Keep things positive and inclusive
- No personal attacks, discrimination, or drama
- If someone posts a game, try to respond so they know the numbers

## Admin Decisions

Admins and organisers are all volunteers. If a post gets removed or a decision is made, it's to keep things running smoothly. If you're unsure about something, just ask.

**Breaking these rules may result in a warning, and repeated violations may lead to removal from the group.**

# WhatsApp Group Rules 📱

Welcome to Keep Calm and Carry On! To keep our WhatsApp groups friendly and functional for everyone, please follow these guidelines.

## General Etiquette

### Keep Messages Relevant
- **Post only sport/event-related content** in sport-specific groups
- Use the appropriate group for your message (don't cross-post unnecessarily)
- Save general chat for the social group or in-person meetups

### Minimize Noise
- **Keep the chat manageable** - important updates need to be easy to find
- Avoid excessive back-and-forth conversations - use private messages when possible
- Don't spam polls, memes, or promotional content
- Limit voice notes and large media files

### Be Positive
- Keep communication friendly and constructive
- **No negativity or complaints** that don't help solve problems
- Especially important during weather issues - trust the organizers and rain policies
- Support fellow members and welcome newcomers

### Respect Others
- Be inclusive and welcoming to all members
- Respect different skill levels and backgrounds
- No harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate content
- Remember we're all here to have fun and stay active

## Event-Specific Guidelines

### RSVPs and Polls
- **Vote in polls if you plan to attend** - this helps organizers plan
- Only vote if you genuinely intend to participate
- Vote for the time you'll actually arrive (especially for ping pong, volleyball)

### Court Bookings and Links
- When posting Playtomic booking links:
  - Share clearly with all necessary details
  - Tag relevant players
  - Use "Share Externally" feature as instructed
- Share booking links with organizers (e.g., Dan for Padel)

### Changes and Cancellations
- **Give as much notice as possible** if you can't make it
- See [Event Rules](Event-Rules.md) for cancellation policies
- Help find replacements if you need to drop out
- Don't repeatedly ask "Are we playing?" - check pinned messages and trust organizers

### Weather-Related Communication
- **Don't ring venues directly** about cancellations - let organizers handle this
- Don't try to persuade others to cancel
- Trust the process - games are on unless officially cancelled
- Keep weather-related chat minimal

### For Bookers/Organizers
- Post important updates clearly and concisely
- Pin critical information when appropriate
- Share booking confirmations promptly
- Coordinate with other bookers to avoid confusion

## What to Avoid

❌ **Spam** - Promotional content, repeated messages, excessive media
❌ **Off-topic chat** - Save it for social groups or in person
❌ **Negativity** - Complaining without offering solutions
❌ **Pressuring others** - Let people make their own decisions about attending
❌ **Venue harassment** - Don't contact venues directly about bookings/cancellations
❌ **Drama** - Keep it friendly and drama-free

## New Members

### Joining Mid-Week
- If you join between polls, you may need to wait for the next cycle
- Can act as a reserve player or join ad-hoc games
- Use the time to read through pinned messages and get oriented
- Don't hesitate to ask questions - we're here to help!

### Getting Started
- Read pinned messages in each group
- Introduce yourself briefly (name, experience level)
- Check out the sport-specific README files for details
- Join in the next poll or event

## Consequences

We operate on a **3-strike system**:
- **Strike 1**: Warning
- **Strike 2**: Temporary restriction
- **Strike 3**: Removal from the community

Strikes can be given for:
- Repeated rule violations
- Spam or harassment
- No-shows without notice (see Event Rules)
- Negative behavior affecting group morale

## Questions?

If you're unsure about anything:
1. Check the pinned messages in your group
2. Read the sport-specific README
3. Ask an organizer privately
4. Post a polite question in the group

# Welcome to Keep Calm Sunday Padel! 🎾

We're excited to have you join our growing padel community!

## How Our Poll System Works

We organize **one week in advance** to ensure everyone gets to play:

### Timeline
**Week 1:**
- **Saturday morning**: Poll opens for NEXT Sunday's games (a week away)
- **Vote with your availability**: Tell us which time slots work for you
- **Tuesday evening**: Poll closes
- **During the week**: Games are organized and posted

**Week 2:**
- **Sunday**: Games happen! 🎾

This gives everyone plenty of notice and time to plan.

## Fair Play Guarantee

Our mission is simple but important: **we work hard to ensure that every single person who votes in our poll gets a guaranteed spot to play padel.**

- We organize multiple sessions across different time slots
- We accommodate all skill levels (Beginner to Advanced)
- We'll find a way to fit you in - that's a promise!

## What Happens After You Vote?

1. **Consider your spot secured** - once you vote, we'll organize a game for you
2. **Check the games post** - we'll share court assignments during the week
3. **Book or join**:
   - You might be assigned as the **booker** - book the court ASAP via Playtomic
   - Or you'll **join a court** - wait for the booker to share the link
4. **Show up and play!**

Happy weekend everyone - as per normal please vote for the time slots you WILL play for next weekend. Keep in mind that if you book multiple slots you WILL be volunteering for multiple games and expected to play them.  Make sure you check your schedule beforehand, and keep in mind it takes time to get to and from the venue, the games will last 1 hour and 30 minutes. We normally play between 16:00 and 19:00, followed by drinks and food on the terrace. If you need any information, please PM me.

On Monday or Tuesday evening (around 18:00), An organiser take a snapshot of the poll results and organize the games. Due to many changes, dropouts and lates we are taking a much strict approach to player management. Any infringements will likely result in removal from the group so please be cautious and communicate issues early.

Please keep in mind that it’s hard to manage everyone’s abilities and expectation but we will try our best when organising the matches, some times there is good and other times there is bad, try to remain positive!

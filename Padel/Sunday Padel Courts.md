Using the template below, arrange padel games based on the attached CSV file. Follow these rules when creating the games:

**Player Assignment Rules:**
1. Randomize players within each level/time slot
2. Create additional courts when more than 4 players are available for the same level/time slot
3. Fill empty slots with "Spare Place"
4. Format all player names as "Firstname L" (first name + last initial only)

**Booking Rules:**
5. Designate one player from each match (normally the first listed) as the "booker"
6. Each player can only be assigned as booker once - do not reuse the same person to book multiple courts

**Verification Process:**
After generating the initial arrangement, systematically verify:
- Every player from the CSV appears in their correct time slot(s)
- Every player has all the games they signed up for
- No player is double-booked at the same time
- Booking assignments follow the rules above

**Output Format:**
Please provide the output as markdown, clearly showing:
- Court assignments for each time slot and level
- Booker designation for each court
- Date should be replaced with next Sunday's date

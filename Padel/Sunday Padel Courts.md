Using the below template, arrange padel games based on the poll preferences shown in the attached CSV. Provide output in markdown format. With all the below constraints please go through them systematically to make sure one constraint does not impede on one another. Before finalizing, list all constraints and verify each one individually

General requests/constraints;
Randomize players within each level/time slot (don't organize by poll submission time)
Create additional courts if more than 4 players are available for the same level/time slot.
When someone is selected as the "booker" they must not be used as the "booker" for any other court.
Fill empty slots with "Spare Place" and where possible recommend to me where I should move a player to fill these slots.
When outputting players their second names should be truncated to just the first letter for example "Firstname A".
After generating the initial arrangement, systematically verify that EVERY player from the poll images appears in their chosen time slots - cross-reference each image against the final arrangement to ensure no one is missed.

Please provide the output as markdown.

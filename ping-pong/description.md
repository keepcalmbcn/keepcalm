Keep Calm Ping Pong (Table Tennis) - part of the Keep Calm and Carry On community for English speakers in Barcelona.

We play every Thursday from 18:00 at the outdoor tables in Sants. All levels welcome, equipment provided. Just turn up and play!

A poll goes out midweek so we know who's coming and when. Vote for your arrival time (18:00, 18:30, or 19:00).

Cost: Free! Public outdoor tables.

Cancelled if raining - check this group for updates.

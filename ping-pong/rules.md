# Keep Calm Ping Pong - Group Rules

Welcome to Keep Calm Ping Pong! To keep things fun and fair for everyone, please follow these guidelines.

> These rules apply on top of our general WhatsApp rules:
> https://github.com/keepcalmbcn/keepcalm/blob/main/keep-calm/rules/whatsapp-rules.md

## 1. Language

English is our primary language in the chat. It's the most inclusive option when we have members from 30+ nationalities and easiest for us to moderate. Feel free to speak whatever you like in person!

## 2. Polls and Attendance

- Vote in the weekly poll for the time you'll actually arrive
- If you vote, make the effort to show up
- If your plans change, update the group so we know the numbers

## 3. Sharing the Tables

- We rotate players so everyone gets fair court time
- Don't hog a table - let others have a go
- Mix up who you play with, especially with newer members
- If it's busy, keep games shorter so more people can play

## 4. Equipment

- Look after shared rackets and balls - they belong to everyone
- If you borrow a racket, return it in the same condition
- Bring your own if you can, but don't worry if you can't

## 5. Weather

- Sessions are cancelled if it's raining (outdoor tables)
- Check the WhatsApp group if the weather looks dodgy
- No official update usually means we're still on

## 6. Be Sound

- Welcome newcomers and help them settle in
- All skill levels play together - be patient with beginners
- Keep things friendly and positive
- No personal attacks, discrimination, or drama

## Admin Decisions

Admins and organisers are all volunteers. If a post gets removed or a decision is made, it's to keep things running smoothly. If you're unsure about something, just ask.

**Breaking these rules may result in a warning, and repeated violations may lead to removal from the group.**

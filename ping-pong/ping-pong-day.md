Good morning all,

As always, this Thursday we’ll be playing table tennis / ping pong! 

The games will take place across the three main tables at the attached location, and if we have enough players, we can also use a couple of nearby tables. A polite reminder that people will start arriving at 18:00, but you’re more than welcome to join later and/or stay longer.

This event is open to all levels and abilities—we’ll mix up the games accordingly. We also have spare rackets and balls in case you don’t have your own or forget to bring them. Just remember to bring some water and, of course, good vibes!

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out!

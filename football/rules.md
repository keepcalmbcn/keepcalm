# Keep Calm Football - Group Rules

Welcome to Keep Calm Football! To keep things fun and fair for everyone, please follow these guidelines.

> These rules apply on top of our general WhatsApp rules:
> https://github.com/keepcalmbcn/keepcalm/blob/main/keep-calm/rules/whatsapp-rules.md

## 1. Language

English is our primary language in the chat. It's the most inclusive option when we have members from 30+ nationalities and easiest for us to moderate. Feel free to speak whatever you like on the pitch!

## 2. Attendance

- If you say you're playing, show up
- Football needs even numbers, so dropping out last minute can ruin the game for everyone
- If your plans change, let the group know as soon as possible so someone else can take your spot

## 3. Fair Play

- Keep it friendly - no reckless tackles or aggressive play
- All skill levels play together, so be patient and inclusive
- Rotate teams and mix things up
- Arguments over calls? Sort it quickly and move on

## 4. Payment

- If there's a pitch fee, pay your share promptly
- Don't leave others to cover your cost
- If you cancel last minute, you may still owe your share depending on how the booking works

## 5. Safety

- Wear appropriate footwear for the surface (boots, astros, etc.)
- Warm up before playing
- Bring water and stay hydrated
- If you're injured, don't push through - sit one out

## 6. Be Sound

- Welcome newcomers and get them involved in the game
- Keep things positive on and off the pitch
- No personal attacks, discrimination, or drama
- One clear message in the group beats ten one-word messages

## Admin Decisions

Admins and organisers are all volunteers. If a post gets removed or a decision is made, it's to keep things running smoothly. If you're unsure about something, just ask.

**Breaking these rules may result in a warning, and repeated violations may lead to removal from the group.**

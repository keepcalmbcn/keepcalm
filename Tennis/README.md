# Keep Calm Tennis 🎾

Welcome to Tuesday Tennis! Our weekly tennis sessions bring together players for organized games at local courts.

## Weekly Schedule

**Every Tuesday**
- **Time**: 18:00 - 21:00 (times vary based on court availability)
- **Duration**: Typically 90 minutes per booking (can be 1.5-3 hours)
- **Venue**: Up Pádel & Tennis Cornellà - [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Yri55DyC9qqTAuYw8)

## How It Works

Similar to our Padel system, tennis uses a poll-based organization:

### Before Tuesday
- **Poll posted**: Usually Monday/Tuesday (weekend before the game)
- **Vote in the poll**: Let us know if you're interested
- **Games organized**: Based on poll results

### Booking Process
- Games organized into courts (4 players per court for doubles)
- One person per court designated as **booker**
- **Book via Playtomic**: Same app as Padel
- **Share link**: Booker shares link with other 3 players

### On Tuesday
- **Arrive on time** for your booked slot
- **Play tennis!**
- **Pay your share** through Playtomic

## Organizers

## Player Management

We take a **strict approach to player management** for tennis:

- **Show up if you commit** - others are depending on you
- **Late cancellations** = strikes (see Event Rules)
- **No-shows** = potential removal from group
- **Communicate early** if you have any issues

This ensures fairness for everyone and maintains good venue relationships.

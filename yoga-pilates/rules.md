# Keep Calm Yoga & Pilates - Group Rules

Welcome to Keep Calm Yoga & Pilates! To keep things enjoyable for everyone, please follow these guidelines.

> These rules apply on top of our general WhatsApp rules:
> https://github.com/keepcalmbcn/keepcalm/blob/main/keep-calm/rules/whatsapp-rules.md

## 1. Language

English is our primary language in the chat. It's the most inclusive option when we have members from 30+ nationalities and easiest for us to moderate. Feel free to speak whatever you like in person!

## 2. Attendance

- If you sign up for a session, make the effort to show up
- If there's a cost involved, your spot could mean someone else misses out
- If your plans change, let the group know so someone else can take your place

## 3. During Sessions

- Arrive on time - turning up late disrupts the class for everyone
- Follow the instructor's guidance
- Keep noise to a minimum during the session
- Be mindful of the space around you

## 4. Equipment

- Bring your own mat if you have one
- If mats are provided, look after them and clean up after yourself
- Bring water and a towel

## 5. All Levels Welcome

- Don't worry if you've never done yoga or pilates before
- Listen to your body and don't push beyond what's comfortable
- Be supportive of others regardless of their experience

## 6. Be Sound

- Welcome newcomers and help them feel at ease
- Keep the atmosphere calm and positive
- No personal attacks, discrimination, or drama

## Admin Decisions

Admins and organisers are all volunteers. If a post gets removed or a decision is made, it's to keep things running smoothly. If you're unsure about something, just ask.

**Breaking these rules may result in a warning, and repeated violations may lead to removal from the group.**

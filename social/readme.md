# Keep Calm Social

Welcome to Keep Calm Social! This is where we organise everything that isn't sport - dinners, drinks, beach days, day trips, markets, festivals, and whatever else sounds fun.

Part of the larger **Keep Calm and Carry On** not-for-profit community for English speakers in Barcelona, we're built on values of inclusivity, reliability, and collaboration. Everyone is welcome, and the community belongs to all of us.

## How It Works

Anyone can suggest a plan. Just post something like *"I'm going to X, who wants to join?"* and see who's in. If it's a bigger event, an admin will help organise it properly.

## What Kind of Events?

- Dinners and drinks
- Beach days
- Day trips
- Markets and festivals
- Cultural events
- Movie nights
- Whatever else people come up with!

## Posting Events

- **Casual invites** ("Who wants to grab dinner Saturday?") are always welcome
- **External event links, flyers, or Meetup links** need admin approval first
- **Paid events** (festivals, experiences, etc.) - suggest it casually and an admin will create an official post if there's interest
- No promoting other communities or groups

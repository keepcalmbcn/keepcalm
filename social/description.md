The following is used as the WhatsApp group description.

---

Keep Calm Social - part of the Keep Calm and Carry On community for English speakers in Barcelona.

This group is for organising social events, meetups, and activities outside of sport. Think dinners, drinks, beach days, day trips, markets, festivals, and anything else that brings people together.

Want to do something? Post it! "I'm going to X, who wants to join?" is always welcome.

No external event links or flyers without admin approval. Casual invites to do stuff together are what this group is about.

# Keep Calm Social - Group Rules 📋

Welcome to Keep Calm! We're Barcelona's home for English speakers to stay active, make friends, and feel like they belong. To keep things running smoothly, please follow these guidelines.

> These rules apply on top of our general WhatsApp rules:
> https://github.com/keepcalmbcn/keepcalm/blob/main/keep-calm/rules/whatsapp-rules.md

## 1. Language

English is our primary language in the chat. It's the most inclusive option when we have members from 30+ nationalities and easiest for us to moderate. Feel free to speak whatever you like in person at events!

## 2. Event Posting

✅ *"I'm going to X, who wants to join?"* Always welcome. Casual invites to do things together are what this group is about.

✅ **Official Keep Calm events** posted by admins/organisers.

❌ **External event links, flyers, Meetup/Luma links, or Instagram posts.** Not permitted without admin approval. If you'd like to share something, message an admin first.

❌ **Promoting other communities, groups, or platforms.** This includes subtle recruitment (e.g. "dm me to join"). We put a lot of volunteer effort into building this space and ask that you respect that.

## 3. Ticketed / Paid Events

If you want to suggest a paid event (festival, brunch, experience, etc.) post it as a casual suggestion:

*"Could we consider Palo Alto Market on the 8th?"*

If there's interest, an admin will create an official event with the relevant details and links. Don't post ticket links or payment details directly.

## 4. Commercial Activity

No buying/selling (whatsoever) products, tickets, services, flats, or posting affiliate/referral links. 

If you run a business relevant to the community (e.g. a local venue or activity), reach out to an admin.

## 5. Be Sound

- Be welcoming to newcomers. Remember what it felt like when you first arrived in Barcelona.
- Keep debates respectful. No personal attacks, discrimination, or drama.
- Don't spam the chat. One message with context beats ten one-word messages.

## 6. Admin Decisions

Admins are all volunteers. If a post gets removed, it's nothing personal. It's to keep the group useful and spam-free.

If you're unsure whether something is okay to post, just ask an admin first.

**Breaking these rules may result in a warning, and repeated violations may lead to removal from the group.**

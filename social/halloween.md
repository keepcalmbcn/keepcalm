Hey everyone! 🎃

Just wanted to say a huge thanks to all of you who came out last night — we had over 20 people turn up, which was amazing! The costumes were absolutely brilliant (some of you went all out 👻🧙‍♂) and the drinks kept flowing all night.

It was such a great vibe — lots of laughs, good chats, and spooky fun all around. Really appreciate everyone for making it such a memorable Halloween! 🕸

Halloween we struggled to find venues that didn't require expensive tickets?
The venue we went with was very dark and also noisy, the venue is extremely important.
If we arrange earlier people will get costumes in time.

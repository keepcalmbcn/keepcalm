# Keep Calm Volleyball 🏐

Welcome to our beach volleyball community! We're an active, flexible group that plays year-round at Barcelona's beaches.

## How It Works

Unlike our more structured padel system, **volleyball is organized on an ad-hoc basis** by members in the WhatsApp group:

- **Spontaneous games**: Someone posts "Who's up for volleyball today?" and others join
- **Planned sessions**: Regular Saturday sessions and other organized games
- **Flexible scheduling**: Games happen throughout the week as members propose them

## Regular Saturday Sessions

**Mario** typically organizes Saturday beach volleyball:
- **When**: Saturdays 16:00-19:00 (3 one-hour slots)
- **Where**: Nova Icaria or Somorrostro beaches (depending on court availability)
- **Format**: 5 vs 5 with rotation when serving
- **Capacity**: 12 people per slot (can be flexible)
- **What's provided**: Net and balls (Mario brings them)
- **Announcement**: Usually posted Thursday/Friday

### How to Join Saturday Sessions
1. Watch for Mario's announcement in the WhatsApp group
2. Vote in the poll for your preferred time slot(s)
3. Max 2 slots per person initially (more if spots remain after 24h)
4. Show up and play!

## Common Beach Locations

Our volleyball community plays at various beaches with public nets:

- **Nova Icaria** - Popular spot, good facilities nearby
- **Somorrostro** - Close to Barceloneta, great atmosphere
- **Bogatell** - Public nets available
- **Barceloneta** - Classic beach volleyball location

**Public nets**: Free to use, first-come first-served

## What to Bring

- **Water** - Stay hydrated!
- **Comfortable sports clothing** - Beach-appropriate attire
- **Sunscreen** - Barcelona sun can be strong
- **Good vibes** - Most important!

**Equipment**: Usually provided by organizers (net, balls), but feel free to bring your own if you have some!

## Year-Round Play

- **Summer**: Outdoor beach volleyball
- **Winter**: Still playing outdoors when weather permits
- **Indoor options**: Some members organize indoor volleyball at local clubs

## Skill Levels

**All levels welcome!**

- Beginners learning the basics
- Recreational players for fun
- More experienced players
- We mix it up and everyone plays together!

The format allows for natural skill balancing through rotation and team mixing.

## Cost

**FREE!** We use public beach nets.

Occasionally for indoor volleyball at clubs, there may be a small venue fee - this will be communicated in advance.

## Organizers

- **Chris**
- **Mario**
- **Nix**

They coordinate sessions, bring equipment, and keep things organized.

## Tips for Beach Volleyball

- **Arrive early** to claim a public net (they can fill up)
- **Beach shoes optional** - most play barefoot
- **Check wind conditions** - strong wind affects play
- **Bring water** - there's often no shade
- **Be sun-safe** - hat, sunglasses, sunscreen

## Social Aspect

Volleyball is as much about the social vibe as the sport:
- Great way to meet people
- Often grab drinks after games
- Very inclusive and friendly atmosphere
- Perfect for making friends in Barcelona

## Winter/Indoor Plans

As mentioned in our docs, we're looking to organize **indoor volleyball sessions for winter** when beach conditions aren't ideal.

Watch the WhatsApp group for announcements about indoor venues and sessions!

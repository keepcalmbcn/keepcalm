🏐 Saturday Social Volleyball 🏐

Hey everyone! 🏐☀

This Saturday, @Mario  is hosting beach volleyball from 16:00–19:00 (3 slots of 1 hour each) at Nova Icaria or Somorrostro beaches!

📅 When: Saturday, 16:00–19:00
📍 Where: Nova Icaria (or Somorrostro, depending on court availability)

How it works:

Each 1-hour slot can be booked first come first come, first served with the poll below.

Limit: 12 people per slot →
 • 2 teams of 5 vs 5 (with rotation when serving).

For now, max 2 slots per person. If after 24h there are open spots, you can grab more.

If slots are full, use this chat to swap or negotiate with someone — keep it friendly and transparent 😊

If you can’t make it, please drop out of the event and post it here so someone else can join 🙌

If anyone else has a net or balls please feel free to bring these too and maybe we can get more games going!

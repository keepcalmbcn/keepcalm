⛷️ Social Ski Trip to Andorra - 23-25 January 2026 ⛷️
Hey everyone! We're organizing a ski trip to Grandvalira in Andorra and would love to have more people join us on the slopes!
📅 Dates: Friday 23rd - Sunday 25th January
📍 Location: Grandvalira (Soldeu sector), Andorra

We can:

Meet for lunch on the slopes
Ski/snowboard together during the day
Share tips on accommodation and logistics

🚗 Transport & 🏠 Accommodation:
You'll need to organize your own transport (carpooling with others) and accommodation (hotels/apartments in the area), but we're happy to help with recommendations and coordinate meetups using a separate WhatsApp group.

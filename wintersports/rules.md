# Keep Calm Ski/Snowboard - Group Rules

Welcome to Keep Calm Ski/Snowboard! To keep things safe and enjoyable for everyone, please follow these guidelines.

> These rules apply on top of our general WhatsApp rules:
> https://github.com/keepcalmbcn/keepcalm/blob/main/keep-calm/rules/whatsapp-rules.md

## 1. Language

English is our primary language in the chat. It's the most inclusive option when we have members from 30+ nationalities and easiest for us to moderate. Feel free to speak whatever you like on the slopes!

## 2. Commitment

- If you commit to a trip, follow through
- Others may book accommodation, transport, or lift passes based on your attendance
- If your plans change, let the group know as early as possible

## 3. Safety

- Ski and snowboard at your own risk - know your limits
- Stick to runs that match your ability level
- Wear a helmet (strongly recommended)
- Follow the mountain's safety rules and signage
- Let someone know if you're going off on your own
- Have emergency contacts accessible on your phone

## 4. Logistics

- Organise your own transport and accommodation unless a group option is arranged
- Coordinate carpooling in the group - share costs fairly
- Be on time for agreed meeting points and departure times
- Don't hold the group up

## 5. Costs

- Ski trips aren't cheap - be upfront about shared costs (petrol, accommodation, passes)
- Settle up promptly after the trip
- If you drop out and others have booked based on your commitment, be prepared to cover your share

## 6. Be Sound

- Welcome newcomers, especially if it's their first time skiing or snowboarding
- Help with logistics and share tips about the resort
- Look out for each other on the mountain
- No personal attacks, discrimination, or drama

## Admin Decisions

Admins and organisers are all volunteers. If a post gets removed or a decision is made, it's to keep things running smoothly. If you're unsure about something, just ask.

**Breaking these rules may result in a warning, and repeated violations may lead to removal from the group.**

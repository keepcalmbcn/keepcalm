# Keep Calm Ski/Snowboard

Welcome to Keep Calm & Ski/Snowboard On! We organise ski and snowboard trips from Barcelona during the winter season.

Part of the larger **Keep Calm and Carry On** not-for-profit community for English speakers in Barcelona, we're built on values of inclusivity, reliability, and collaboration. Everyone is welcome, and the community belongs to all of us.

- [General WhatsApp Rules](../keep-calm/rules/whatsapp-rules.md) - applies to all Keep Calm groups

## How It Works

Trips are coordinated through the WhatsApp group. Someone proposes a trip, others join in, and we sort out the logistics together. These aren't fully packaged trips - you organise your own transport and accommodation, but we coordinate as a group and meet up at the resort.

## Where We Go

Resorts within reach of Barcelona:
- **Grandvalira** (Andorra) - Spain's largest resort, 210km of slopes, 2.5-3 hours drive
- **Masella / La Molina** (Pyrenees) - closer options, around 2 hours
- Other Pyrenean resorts depending on snow conditions

## Typical Trip

- Weekend trips (Friday to Sunday or Saturday to Sunday)
- Carpooling coordinated in the group
- Meet up on the slopes during the day
- Shared meals and social time in the evenings
- All levels welcome, from first-timers to experienced riders

## Costs

These vary by trip, but roughly:
- Lift pass: 50-80 euros per day
- Equipment rental: 30-40 euros per day
- Transport: shared fuel costs for carpooling
- Accommodation: varies depending on what you book

# Keep Calm Ski/Snowboard - Group Description

The following is used as the WhatsApp group description.

---

Keep Calm & Ski/Snowboard On - part of the Keep Calm and Carry On community for English speakers in Barcelona.

Ski and snowboard trips from Barcelona to the Pyrenees and Andorra during winter season. We coordinate group trips, share carpooling, and meet up on the slopes.

All levels welcome, from first-timers to experienced riders.

Trips are self-organised - sort your own transport, accommodation, and lift passes, but we coordinate as a group and meet up at the resort.

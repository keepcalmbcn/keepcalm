# Language Policy

Keep Calm is a community for English speakers in Barcelona. We have members from 30+ nationalities, and English is the common language that connects us all. That said, we're living in Catalonia, and we respect that.

## In WhatsApp Groups

**English only.** All messages in Keep Calm WhatsApp groups should be in English. This keeps things inclusive and easy to follow for everyone, and makes it possible for our admins and moderators to keep an eye on things.

Other languages should be avoided in group chats. If you need to communicate in another language, take it to a private message.

## At Events and In Person

**English is the main language**, but feel free to use Spanish, Catalan, or whatever works in the moment. If you're chatting with someone who shares another language, go for it. The important thing is that nobody feels excluded from the wider group conversation.

If there's a group discussion happening, try to keep it in English so everyone can follow along.

## Private and One-to-One Communication

Completely up to you. If you're messaging someone privately or having a side conversation, use whatever language you both prefer. This policy only applies to group settings.

## Why English?

It's not about English being better than any other language. It's practical. When you have people from dozens of different countries, you need a common language so everyone can participate. English happens to be the one that most of our members share.

We know it can feel weird speaking English when you're in Spain and you speak Spanish. But remember, the person next to you might not, and we want everyone to feel included.

**In short: English in the groups, flexible in person, whatever you like in private.**

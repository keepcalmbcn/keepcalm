# Community Conduct

This document covers how we treat each other in Keep Calm. It goes beyond event logistics to address respect, inclusion, advertising, privacy, and conflict resolution.

---

## Our Community Standards

Keep Calm exists to bring English speakers together through sport. That only works if everyone feels welcome, respected, and safe.

### The Basics

- **Treat everyone with respect** regardless of skill level, background, nationality, gender, or experience
- **Assume good intentions** - misunderstandings happen, especially in a multicultural community
- **Be welcoming** - remember what it felt like to be new
- **Keep it friendly** - we're here for fun, not competition or drama

---

## Respect & Inclusion

### What We Expect

**Be inclusive:**
- Welcome newcomers and help them feel comfortable
- Include people in conversations, not just games
- Be patient with different skill levels
- Respect that people have different schedules and commitments

**Be respectful:**
- Listen when others speak
- Accept that people have different opinions
- Give feedback kindly, not critically
- Respect personal boundaries

**Be supportive:**
- Encourage others, especially beginners
- Celebrate improvements, not just wins
- Help people learn rather than criticising mistakes
- Build people up, don't knock them down

### What We Don't Tolerate

**Harassment:**
- Unwanted attention or repeated contact after being asked to stop
- Unsolicited DMs - sending group invites, event invites, promotions, or personal messages to members who didn't ask for them
- Messages that are flirty, sexual, or otherwise make someone uncomfortable
- Sexual harassment in any form
- Intimidating or threatening behavior
- Following or stalking (online or offline)

**Discrimination:**
- Comments or behavior targeting someone's race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, or appearance
- Exclusion based on these characteristics
- "Jokes" that punch down at groups or individuals

**Bullying:**
- Repeated negative comments aimed at the same person
- Deliberate exclusion from games or social activities
- Mocking someone's skill level or ability
- Spreading rumors or gossip

**Aggression:**
- Threatening language or behavior
- Physical intimidation
- Excessive anger during games
- Making others feel unsafe

### Grey Areas

Some situations aren't clear-cut. Use this test:

> "Would I be comfortable if an organiser saw/heard this?"

If you're unsure whether something is appropriate, it probably isn't. When in doubt, don't.

## Advertising & Self-Promotion

Keep Calm is a non-commercial community. This shapes what can and can't be shared in our groups.

### What's Not Allowed

**In WhatsApp groups:**
- Promoting your business, coaching, or services
- Sharing your own paid events or workshops
- Affiliate links or referral codes
- Job postings or recruitment
- Requests to share/like your social media or business pages

**At events:**
- Actively selling products or services
- Handing out business cards or flyers uninvited
- Pitching your business to other members
- Using Keep Calm as a lead generation channel

### What's Allowed

**Personal mentions:**
- Mentioning what you do for work in normal conversation is fine
- If someone asks for a recommendation and you happen to do that thing, you can mention it
- Sharing your work if someone specifically requests it

**Helpful information:**
- "There's a sale on padel rackets at Decathlon" = fine (you don't benefit)
- "Buy rackets through my shop for 10% off" = not fine (you benefit)

**Community benefit:**
- Free resources that genuinely help members
- Venues offering special rates for Keep Calm (coordinated through organisers)
- Equipment donations or group purchases

### How to Handle It

**If you want to share something borderline:**
1. Ask an organiser first
2. Explain what it is and why it might be useful
3. Accept their decision

**If someone promotes to you:**
- You're not obligated to engage
- If it's in a group, you can flag it to an organiser
- If it's persistent or uncomfortable, tell an organiser

**If you're an organiser and see promotion:**
1. Send a private message explaining the policy
2. If it's a first offense, assume they didn't know
3. If repeated, treat as a strike offense

---

## Photography & Privacy

- Ask before taking photos that feature specific people prominently
- Group shots are generally fine — give people a moment to step aside if they prefer
- Don't share unflattering photos of others or tag people who prefer not to be tagged
- Contact details, home addresses, and anything shared in confidence stays private

For the full photography and data policy, see [data-privacy.md](data-privacy.md).

## Conflict Resolution

Disagreements happen. How we handle them matters.

### Step 1: Direct Conversation

If you have an issue with someone:
- Talk to them directly and privately first
- Assume it might be a misunderstanding
- Be specific about what bothered you
- Listen to their perspective
- Try to resolve it between yourselves

### Step 2: Organiser Support

If direct conversation doesn't work:
- Contact an organiser privately
- Explain the situation calmly and specifically
- Share what you've already tried
- Ask for their help mediating

### Step 3: Core Team Involvement

For serious issues or if organiser mediation fails:
- The issue will be escalated to the core team
- Both parties will be heard
- A decision will be made about next steps
- This may include warnings, restrictions, or removal

### What Organisers Will Do

- Listen to all sides without pre-judging
- Keep conversations confidential where possible
- Take action proportionate to the issue
- Follow up to make sure the situation is resolved
- Document patterns of behavior

### What We Won't Do

- Take sides based on who we know better
- Ignore serious complaints
- Allow retaliation against people who raise concerns
- Discuss private conflicts publicly

---

## Serious Issues

Some things require immediate escalation:

**Report immediately to an organiser:**
- Harassment or threatening behavior
- Any form of discrimination
- Safety concerns
- Illegal activity
- Anyone feeling unsafe

**What happens:**
- The person raising the concern will be supported
- The accused will be spoken to or removed from events pending investigation
- Serious issues may result in immediate removal from Keep Calm
- Criminal matters should be reported to police (organisers can support but aren't a substitute)

---

## Consequences

Conduct violations follow the community's [3-strike system](event-rules.md). Offenses that can trigger strikes include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or bullying
- Repeated advertising after being warned
- Creating a hostile atmosphere or aggressive behavior
- Privacy violations

**Severe offenses** (harassment, threats, discrimination) may result in immediate removal without the normal strike progression.

---

## Creating the Culture We Want

Rules only go so far. Culture is created by everyone, every day.

**Small things that matter:**
- Saying hello to someone standing alone
- Introducing yourself to new faces
- Asking someone how their game went
- Inviting someone to join post-game drinks
- Sending a friendly message to check in on someone who missed a few sessions
- Thanking organisers publicly
- Giving genuine compliments

**The vibe we're building:**
- People look forward to events, not just for the sport
- Newcomers become regulars become friends
- Different skill levels mix and learn from each other
- People feel comfortable being themselves
- The community improves people's lives in Barcelona

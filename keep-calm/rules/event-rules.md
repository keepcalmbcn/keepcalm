# Event Participation Rules 🎯

These rules help ensure our events run smoothly and fairly for everyone. Please read and follow them.

## Commitment and RSVPs

### When You Sign Up
- **Only RSVP if you genuinely plan to attend**
- Voting in a poll means you're committing to participate
- Check your schedule carefully before responding
- Consider weather, travel time, and other commitments

### Showing Up
- **Arrive on time** for your scheduled slot
- If running late, notify your group/court immediately
- Remember: others are depending on you to make the game happen
- For Padel/Tennis: you're part of a 4-person court - your absence affects 3 others

## Cancellations and Dropouts

### How Much Notice to Give
- **24+ hours notice**: Generally acceptable - give as much notice as possible
- **Same-day cancellations**: Only for genuine emergencies
- **No-shows**: Unacceptable without very good reason

### Proper Cancellation Process
1. **Update your RSVP/poll response** immediately
2. **Post in the WhatsApp group** to let everyone know
3. **Help find a replacement** if possible
4. **Notify the booker** (for Padel/Tennis) so they can adjust

### Finding Replacements
- Make an effort to find someone to take your spot
- Post in the WhatsApp group with game details
- Tag people who might be interested
- Check with people on waiting lists or reserves

## Payment Responsibilities

### For Paid Activities (Padel, Tennis)
- **You're responsible for your share** if you signed up
- Payment through Playtomic or venue as instructed
- If you cancel with short notice, you may still owe payment
- Don't leave others to cover your cost

### For Free Activities (Ping Pong, Volleyball)
- Still need to show up if you committed
- Help bring equipment if asked (balls, nets, rackets)

### For Events with Costs (Hiking, Social)
- Train tickets, venue fees, etc. are your responsibility
- Buy tickets as soon as possible after confirming attendance
- Don't rely on others to buy for you

## The Wall of Shame and Strike System

### What is the Wall of Shame?
- A record kept by organizers of rule violations and no-shows
- Helps track patterns of unreliable behavior
- Used to maintain community quality and fairness

### Strike System
We operate on a **3-strike system**:

**Offenses that result in strikes:**
- No-shows without notice or valid reason
- Repeated late cancellations (less than 24 hours)
- Not paying your share for paid activities
- Consistently disruptive behavior
- Breaking WhatsApp rules repeatedly
- Leaving courts/groups without helping find replacements

**Consequences:**
- **Strike 1**: Warning + added to Wall of Shame
- **Strike 2**: Temporary restriction from events
- **Strike 3**: Permanent removal from Keep Calm community

**Strike removal:**
- Good behavior over time may result in strike removal
- Organizers have discretion based on circumstances

## Weather Policies

### General Approach
- **Events are ON unless officially cancelled**
- Don't assume cancellation just because of rain forecast
- Trust organizers to monitor conditions and communicate

### Padel/Tennis Rain Policy
- Games continue unless:
  - Venue cancels (you'll get full refund)
  - All 4 players on your specific court agree to cancel AND notify organizers
- Don't cancel through the app yourself
- Don't call the venue directly
- Keep WhatsApp chat minimal during weather uncertainty
- If you choose not to play due to weather = normal dropout (see above)

### Outdoor Activities (Volleyball, Ping Pong, Hiking)
- Cancelled if dangerous or unsuitable conditions
- Light rain may not cancel - check with organizers
- Organizers will post updates in WhatsApp groups

## Skill Level Honesty

### Self-Assessment
- **Be honest about your skill level** when joining games
- Better to start lower and move up than frustrate others
- Check sport-specific guidelines for level definitions
- Ask organizers if unsure where you fit

### Padel Levels (Playtomic-based)
- **Beginner**: First time playing or no racket experience
- **Improver**: Playtomic score 0-1
- **Intermediate**: Playtomic score 1-2
- **Advanced**: Playtomic score 2+

### Playing Outside Your Level
- Repeatedly playing at wrong level affects others' enjoyment
- Organizers may reassign you to appropriate level
- Use beginner sessions to learn and improve

## Respect for Venues and Equipment

### Venue Relations
- Be respectful to venue staff
- Follow venue rules and policies
- Don't damage facilities or equipment
- Help us maintain good relationships for future bookings

### Equipment Care
- Treat shared equipment (balls, nets, rackets) with care
- Return borrowed items in good condition
- Report damaged equipment to organizers
- Consider contributing equipment if you can

## Safety and Emergencies

### Genuine Emergencies
- Illness, injury, family emergency = valid reason to miss
- Still try to notify as soon as possible
- Organizers will be understanding of true emergencies
- No strike for legitimate emergency absences

### Your Safety
- **Play at your own risk** - assess your fitness and ability
- Bring water and stay hydrated
- Wear appropriate footwear and clothing
- Tell someone if you're feeling unwell

## Positive Participation

### What We Expect
- **Show up with a positive attitude**
- Be supportive of all skill levels
- Help new members feel welcome
- Contribute to the friendly atmosphere
- Assist with organization when possible

### Social Aspect
- Remember: this is about **community, not just sports**
- Join post-game socials when you can
- Meet new people and make friends
- Help make Keep Calm a great place for everyone

## Special Considerations

### Capacity-Limited Events (Hiking, Beginner Sessions)
- If you sign up and take a spot, you're blocking someone else
- Extra important to honor your commitment
- If you cancel, notify immediately so others can join

### Being a Booker (Padel/Tennis)
- Bookers have extra responsibility
- Book courts promptly after games are posted
- Share links with all players
- Monitor your court and coordinate with players
- Report issues to organizers

## Questions or Issues?

### If You Have a Problem
- Contact the sport organizer (see [SCHEDULE.md](../operations/schedule.md))
- Explain the situation honestly
- Work together to find a solution
- Don't air grievances in the main WhatsApp groups

### If You Disagree with a Strike
- Contact the organizers privately
- Provide your explanation calmly
- Be open to feedback
- Accept decisions gracefully

---

## The Bottom Line

**If you commit to an event, show up.**

If you can't show up, give notice and help find a replacement.

If you repeatedly can't follow through, this community may not be the right fit.

We want to keep Keep Calm positive, reliable, and fun for everyone. Thanks for doing your part!

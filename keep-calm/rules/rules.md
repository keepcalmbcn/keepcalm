## Quick Summary

### The Essentials
1. **Be respectful** - Treat all members with kindness, patience, and inclusion
2. **Show up** - If you commit, honor that commitment
3. **Communicate** - Give notice if you can't make it
4. **Be positive** - Keep the vibe friendly and welcoming
5. **Follow through** - Pay your share, help find replacements, be reliable
6. **No advertising** - This is a non-commercial community, not a marketing channel
7. **Respect privacy** - Ask before photographing, don't share personal info
8. **Play safe** - You participate at your own risk

### Zero Tolerance
- Harassment, discrimination, or bullying
- Threatening or aggressive behaviour
- Making others feel unsafe

### The Consequences
- **[3-strike system](event-rules.md)**: Violations result in warnings, then restrictions, then removal
- **Wall of Shame**: We track rule violations and no-shows
- **Immediate removal**: Serious conduct violations may skip the strike system

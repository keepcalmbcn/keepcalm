# WhatsApp Group Rules 📱

Welcome to Keep Calm and Carry On! To keep our WhatsApp groups friendly and functional for everyone, please follow these guidelines.

## General Etiquette

### Keep Messages Relevant
- **Post only sport/event-related content** in sport-specific groups
- Use the appropriate group for your message (don't cross-post unnecessarily)
- Save general chat for the social group or in-person meetups

### Minimize Noise
- **Keep the chat manageable** - important updates need to be easy to find
- Avoid excessive back-and-forth conversations - use private messages when possible
- Don't spam polls, memes, or promotional content
- Limit voice notes and large media files

### Be Positive
- Keep communication friendly and constructive
- **No negativity or complaints** that don't help solve problems
- Especially important during weather issues - trust the organizers and rain policies
- Support fellow members and welcome newcomers

### Respect Others
- Be inclusive and welcoming to all members
- Respect different skill levels and backgrounds
- No harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate content
- Remember we're all here to have fun and stay active

## Event-Specific Guidelines

### RSVPs and Polls
- **Vote in polls if you plan to attend** - this helps organizers plan
- Only vote if you genuinely intend to participate
- Vote for the time you'll actually arrive (especially for ping pong, volleyball)

### Court Bookings and Links
- When posting Playtomic booking links:
  - Share clearly with all necessary details
  - Tag relevant players
  - Use "Share Externally" feature as instructed
- Share booking links with your sport organiser

### Changes and Cancellations
- **Give as much notice as possible** if you can't make it
- See [Event Rules](event-rules.md) for cancellation policies
- Help find replacements if you need to drop out
- Don't repeatedly ask "Are we playing?" - check pinned messages and trust organizers

### Weather-Related Communication
- **Don't ring venues directly** about cancellations - let organizers handle this
- Don't try to persuade others to cancel
- Trust the process - games are on unless officially cancelled
- Keep weather-related chat minimal

### For Bookers/Organizers
- Post important updates clearly and concisely
- Pin critical information when appropriate
- Share booking confirmations promptly
- Coordinate with other bookers to avoid confusion

## Unsolicited Direct Messages

Being in the same Keep Calm group does not give you permission to DM other members out of the blue. This is something we take seriously.

### What's not OK

- Sending group invites, event invites, or promotional messages to people who didn't ask for them
- Adding people to other WhatsApp groups without their permission
- Messaging someone repeatedly after they haven't responded or have asked you to stop
- Sending messages that are flirty, sexual, or otherwise make people uncomfortable
- Using the member list to contact people for personal or commercial reasons

### Why this matters

We've had cases where both men and women in the community have received messages that made them uncomfortable. Keep Calm should be a safe space, and that includes people's inboxes.

### What to do if this happens to you

- **Report it to an admin straight away.** Don't wait, don't brush it off. Screenshot the messages and send them to any admin or organiser.
- You won't be judged for reporting. We'd rather hear about it and act on it.
- The person will be spoken to, and serious or repeated cases will result in removal from the community.

### What to do if you want to message someone

If you've met someone at an event and want to message them about something genuine (plans for the next session, sharing something relevant), that's generally fine. Use common sense. If they don't reply, leave it.

## What to Avoid

❌ **Referral links** - No referral codes, affiliate links, or "sign up with my link" posts of any kind
❌ **Spam** - Promotional content, repeated messages, excessive media
❌ **Off-topic chat** - Save it for social groups or in person
❌ **Negativity** - Complaining without offering solutions
❌ **Pressuring others** - Let people make their own decisions about attending
❌ **Venue harassment** - Don't contact venues directly about bookings/cancellations
❌ **Unsolicited DMs** - Don't message members with invites, promotions, or unwanted contact
❌ **Drama** - Keep it friendly and drama-free

## New Members

### Joining Mid-Week
- If you join between polls, you may need to wait for the next cycle
- Can act as a reserve player or join ad-hoc games
- Use the time to read through pinned messages and get oriented
- Don't hesitate to ask questions - we're here to help!

### Getting Started
- Read pinned messages in each group
- Introduce yourself briefly (name, experience level)
- Check out the sport-specific README files for details
- Join in the next poll or event

## Consequences

We use a [3-strike system](event-rules.md) for repeated violations. In WhatsApp groups, strikes can be given for:

- Repeated rule violations or spam
- Harassment or inappropriate content
- Unsolicited DMs that make members uncomfortable
- Negative behavior affecting group morale

Serious cases (harassment, threatening messages, sexual content) may result in immediate removal without the normal strike progression.

## Questions?

If you're unsure about anything:
1. Check the pinned messages in your group
2. Read the sport-specific README
3. Ask an organizer privately
4. Post a polite question in the group

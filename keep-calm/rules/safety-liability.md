# Safety & Liability

This document outlines safety expectations and liability boundaries for Keep Calm activities. Everyone participating should understand these before joining.

## The Fundamental Principle

**You participate at your own risk.**

Keep Calm is a volunteer-run community that connects people for sports and social activities. We are not a professional sports organisation, and we do not provide insurance, medical support, or guarantees of safety.

By participating in any Keep Calm activity, you accept responsibility for your own wellbeing.

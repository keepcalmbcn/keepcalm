🌹 Happy Valentine’s Day, Keep Calm Community! ❤️

First of all — thank you for being part of the Keep Calm Community. Whether you’ve been with us since day one or just joined recently, you are what makes this community special.

We’ve created a quick survey (5 minutes max) to better understand:

🏀 What sports or activities you’d like to see more of
📅 What days and times you’re actually available
🙋 Whether you’d be interested in organising events, helping out, moderating, or leading sessions

Please remember — we’re a volunteer-run, not-for-profit community. Everything we build is shaped by the people who show up and get involved.

Right now, a small group of volunteers keeps things running. If we want this community to grow, improve, and keep thriving, we need more people to step forward.

That could mean:
* Helping to run an event
* Moderating a chat
* Welcoming newcomers
* Leading a sport/group

This community only works when people participate — not just by attending, but by contributing. Your feedback (and your involvement) will directly shape the future of Keep Calm.

We’re truly grateful to have you here. Let’s build something great together. 💙

Cheers,
The Keep Calm Team ✌️

# Keep Calm Barcelona - Vision

## The One Sentence Vision

> Keep Calm is Barcelona's welcoming home for English speakers to stay active, make friends, and belong—powered by volunteers who care more about community than competition.

---

## What We Are

Keep Calm is a **community platform** for English speakers in Barcelona to find connection through sport.

The sport is the mechanism. Belonging is the outcome.

Our competitive advantage isn't any single activity—it's the unified, welcoming front door to Barcelona's active expat life.

---

## Core Values

1. **Inclusive** - Everyone welcome regardless of skill level or background
2. **Reliable** - Show up if you commit, give notice if you can't
3. **Non-commercial** - About people and community, not profit
4. **Collaborative** - Work with other Barcelona communities, not against them
5. **Ownership** - The community belongs to everyone who participates, not the founders

---

## The Self-Sustaining Model

For Keep Calm to outlast any individual and grow beyond its founders, three things must align:

### 1. Distributed Leadership

Move from *named individuals* to *defined roles*. Instead of one person owning a sport, it becomes:

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Sport Lead** | Owns the weekly rhythm, polls, venues, and strategy |
| **Session Host** | Runs the actual day (can rotate between members) |
| **Beginner Ambassador** | Welcomes and mentors newcomers |
| **Booker** | Handles payments and logistics |

When roles are transferable, the community survives people moving, burning out, or stepping back.

### 2. Self-Generating Participation

The best communities grow from within. We need a clear path for engaged members to step up:

```
Newcomer → Regular → Volunteer → Organizer → Lead
```

- Someone who plays 5+ times should be invited to help
- Someone who helps 3+ times should be invited to organize
- Make this explicit and celebrate it publicly

### 3. Minimal Viable Infrastructure

The community must be able to survive losing any single person. This means:

- Member data lives somewhere permanent
- Polls and sessions can be created by anyone with the role
- New organizers can be onboarded with documented playbooks
- Critical accounts and access are shared appropriately

### Core Team (3-5 people)
- Strategic decisions and cross-sport coordination
- Community health and conflict resolution
- Meets monthly to review and plan

### Sports Leads
- Own their sport end-to-end
- Empowered to make decisions for their sport
- Report monthly on participation and issues

### Community & Social
- Onboarding and welcoming new members
- Events, photography, and member engagement
- The "glue" that connects people across sports

### Ops Team
- Website and social media
- Member data and systems
- Finances (if/when we formalize as asociación)

## Event Types

We think beyond weekly sessions to build a complete community experience:

| Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Weekly Sessions** | Every week | Core activity (Padel Sunday, Tennis Tuesday, etc.) |
| **Beginner Clinics** | Monthly per sport | Entry point for newcomers |
| **Cross-Sport Socials** | Monthly | Members from all sports meet and mix |
| **Seasonal Events** | Quarterly | Halloween, Summer party, Christmas, Season kickoff |
| **Special Trips** | 2-3x per year | Ski trip, large hike, weekend away |

The **cross-sport social** is critical—it's where a volleyball player meets a padel player and tries something new. It's where community identity forms beyond any single sport.

## The Growth Flywheel

```
More members → More organizers step up → More sports/sessions offered
      ↑                                              │
      └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This only works if we actively cultivate organizers from our regular members. Engaged participants become the volunteers who become the leaders who welcome the next wave.

## What We're Not

- **Not a business** - We don't optimize for profit
- **Not exclusive** - We welcome all skill levels
- **Not competing** - We collaborate with other Barcelona communities
- **Not dependent** - No single person is irreplaceable

---

## The Cultural Foundation

Structure enables sustainability, but culture is what makes people stay.

**We celebrate:**
- First-timers showing up nervous and leaving with plans to return
- Regulars stepping up to help without being asked
- Organizers handing off smoothly when life changes
- Cross-sport friendships forming
- Members bringing friends who become regulars

**We protect against:**
- Cliques forming that exclude newcomers
- Burnout in organizers who don't ask for help
- "That's how we've always done it" blocking improvement
- Any individual becoming a single point of failure

This vision should evolve as the community grows. Review quarterly with the core team and update based on what we learn.

Hey! If you've recently moved to Barcelona (or been here a while and just want to meet more people), we'd love you to come along to one of our events.

We're **Keep Calm and Carry On** (https://keepcalm.fit/) — a friendly, not-for-profit sports community for English speakers in Barcelona. A bunch of us started this because we wanted an easy way to stay active and make real friends in the city, without the awkwardness of turning up somewhere alone. We've all been there — it's hard moving to a new place and finding your people. That's basically why we exist.

**What actually happens each week:**

- **Sundays** — Padel sessions across venues like Padel Delfos and Up Padel Cornella (all levels from total beginner to advanced.
- **Tuesdays** — Tennis at Up Padel & Tennis Cornella
- **Thursdays** — Ping pong at Sants public tables (free, just show up!)
- **Daily** — Beach volleyball at spots like Nova Icaria, Bogatell, and Barceloneta (also free)
- **Monthly** — Hiking trips outside the city (just the cost of a train ticket)
- **Social events** — Post-game drinks, seasonal meetups, and whatever else we come up with

You don't need to be good at any of this. Honestly, half the fun is watching each other learn. Whether you've never held a padel racket or you've been playing volleyball for years, you'll fit right in.

**A few things that make us different:**

- We're completely non-commercial — nobody's making money from this, there are no membership fees, and we keep costs as low as possible
- Everything is organised through WhatsApp groups — polls go out, you vote for what you want to join, and you show up. Simple as that
- We actively work with other communities in Barcelona rather than competing with them — the more people playing sport, the better for everyone
- It's run by volunteers who genuinely just want to build something great!

The sport is really just the excuse. What we're actually about is giving people a place to belong in Barcelona. Some of our best moments are the friendships that form between people who came for padel and ended up hiking together, or the nervous first-timer who's now helping organise sessions.

Come try one event. If it's not for you, no pressure at all. But we think you'll like it.

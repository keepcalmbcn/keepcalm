# WhatsApp Member Management

This document outlines our approach to managing WhatsApp group membership to keep the community active and make space for new members.

## Why We Clear Inactive Members

- WhatsApp groups have a member limit (1024 members)
- High-demand groups like padel fill up quickly
- Active communities foster better engagement and connections
- New members deserve the opportunity to join and participate

## The Approach

### Activity Requirement

We ask for minimal engagement - **at least once a month**. This can be:
- Reacting to announcements or messages
- Contributing to conversations
- Participating in polls or events

### Timing & Scale

- **Frequency**: Roughly once a week
- **Volume**: 50-100 members removed per clearing
- **Why so often**: Groups are at capacity and new members can't join - there's a waiting list of people wanting to get involved
- **January**: Extra focus on clearing to start the new year fresh

### Process

1. **Announce in advance** - Give members fair warning before any removals
2. **Explain the criteria** - Make it clear what "active" means
3. **Keep it positive** - Frame it as making space for new community members
4. **Welcome new members** - Use the opportunity to introduce the full range of activities

## Communication Template

Copy-paste ready for WhatsApp (uses WhatsApp formatting: *bold*). Send this every few months as a reminder.

Hey everyone! 👋

*Quick reminder:* We regularly remove inactive members to make space for new folks who want to join our community and be involved in our various sports/activities.

To stay in the group, please just stay active! This can be as simple as:

👍 Reacting to announcements or messages
💬 Contributing to conversations
📣 Participating in polls or events

We only ask for activity *at least once a month* - that's it!

## Best Practices

- **Be transparent** - People appreciate knowing the rules upfront
- **Give grace periods** - Don't remove people without warning
- **Stay welcoming** - The goal is community health, not exclusion
- **Cross-promote** - Use clearing announcements to highlight other activities

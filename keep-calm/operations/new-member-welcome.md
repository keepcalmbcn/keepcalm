# Welcome to Keep Calm!

You've just joined Barcelona's community for English speakers who want to stay active and make friends. Here's everything you need to get started.

## What is Keep Calm?

We're a not-for-profit community that organises weekly sports and social activities. Think of us as your gateway to an active social life in Barcelona—without the awkwardness of showing up alone.

**What we offer:**
- Weekly sessions across multiple sports
- All skill levels welcome (including complete beginners)
- A friendly, inclusive atmosphere
- A way to meet people and make real friends

**What we're not:**
- A commercial business
- A competitive league
- Exclusive or cliquey

---

## Your First Week

### Step 1: Join a WhatsApp Group

You've probably already done this! If not, find the sport you're interested in at [keepcalm.fit](https://keepcalm.fit) and join the WhatsApp group.

### Step 2: Watch for the Poll

Each sport posts a weekly poll asking who can make the next session. When you see it:
- Vote for the time slots that work for you
- Only vote if you genuinely plan to come
- Voting = committing to show up

### Step 3: Check the Games Post

After the poll closes, organisers will post who's playing when. Look for:
- Your name and assigned time/court
- Whether you're the "booker" (you'll book the court) or a player (you'll join someone else's booking)
- Any special instructions

### Step 4: Show Up and Play!

- Arrive on time (or a few minutes early)
- Introduce yourself—everyone knows what it's like to be new
- Have fun!

**For all sports:**

- Don't worry about being perfect
- Ask questions—people love to help

## The Rules (Quick Version)

Full rules are in [Rules.md](../rules/rules.md), but here's the short version:

### Show Up If You Commit
- If you vote in a poll, you're saying you'll be there
- If plans change, give as much notice as possible
- Help find a replacement if you need to cancel

### Be Respectful
- Welcome others, especially newcomers
- Keep WhatsApp on-topic and positive
- No advertising or self-promotion

### The Strike System
- Repeated no-shows or bad behaviour → strikes
- 3 strikes → removal from the community
- Don't worry—just be reliable and you'll be fine

## Tips for Your First Session

### Before
- Check the weather (especially for outdoor sports)
- Bring water and appropriate clothing
- Know where you're going (save the venue address)
- Have the booker's contact if needed

### During
- Introduce yourself: "Hi, I'm [name], this is my first time"
- Don't be shy—everyone's been new
- If you don't understand something, ask
- Focus on having fun, not being perfect

### After
- Stick around for post-game drinks if you can (great way to meet people)
- Say thanks to the organiser
- Let us know how it went—we love feedback!

---

## Making Friends

Sports are the excuse. Friendships are the point.

**Ways to connect:**
- Stay for drinks after sessions
- Chat during breaks and between games
- Try a different sport—you'll meet different people
- Come to social events
- Be a regular—familiarity builds friendship

**It takes time.** Your first session might feel awkward. By session 5, you'll recognise faces. By session 10, you'll have favourites. Keep showing up.

## Getting Involved

After a few sessions, if you enjoy the community:

### Small Ways to Help
- Bring an extra ball or piece of equipment
- Welcome new people (you know how it feels now!)
- Take a photo and share with organisers
- Respond helpfully in WhatsApp

### Bigger Ways to Help
- Become a Booker (coordinate one court)
- Become a Beginner Ambassador (welcome newcomers)
- Help run sessions
- Eventually: become an organiser

See [Role-Descriptions.md](../governance/role-descriptions.md) for all the ways you can contribute.

## Common Questions

### What if I don't know anyone?
That's exactly why we exist. Everyone's been there. Just show up—you'll meet people.

### What if I'm terrible at the sport?
We have all levels. Vote honestly about your skill level and you'll be matched appropriately. No one expects perfection.

### What if I can't make it after signing up?
Post in the group ASAP, help find a replacement if you can, and let the organiser know. Life happens—just communicate.

### What if I want to try a different sport?
Go for it! Join the WhatsApp group for that sport and vote in the next poll.

### What if I have a problem with someone?
Talk to an organiser privately. We take community health seriously. See [Community-Conduct.md](../rules/community-conduct.md).

### What if I want to bring a friend?
Great! Have them join the WhatsApp group and vote in the poll. Don't just show up with extras without checking first.

## One Last Thing

We're glad you found us.

Barcelona can be a hard city to break into socially, especially as an expat or newcomer. Keep Calm exists because someone thought "there should be an easy way for English speakers to play sports and meet people." And now there is.

Show up. Be friendly. Give it a few tries. The friends you make here might be the highlight of your time in Barcelona.

See you on the court! 🎾🏐🏓

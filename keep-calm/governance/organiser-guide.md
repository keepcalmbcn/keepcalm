# Organiser Guide

The playbook for running a sport in Keep Calm. Whether you're taking over or starting something new.

---

## The Commitment

- **Time**: 1-3 hours per week depending on the sport
- **Consistency**: Your sport needs you (or a backup) every week
- **Communication**: Responsive on WhatsApp, especially around event days
- **Duration**: Aim for at least 3-6 months to give the role continuity

You get recognition, input on how your sport runs, and the satisfaction of making it happen. You don't get payment or exemption from community rules. See [Partnerships & Reciprocity](../rules/partnerships-reciprocity.md) for more.

## The Weekly Cycle

Every sport follows a similar rhythm:

| Step | Task |
|------|------|
| **1** | Post poll or announcement for upcoming session |
| **2** | Monitor responses, answer questions |
| **3** | Close poll, organise games/groups/teams |
| **4** | Post final details, confirm with bookers |
| **5** | Event day — be available, handle issues |
| **6** | Follow up on no-shows, thank helpers, note improvements |

**Tips:**
- Post at consistent times each week
- Pin important messages
- Tag @everyone sparingly — reserve for key announcements

---

## Organising Games

For sports that need team formation (padel, tennis, volleyball):

1. Note poll results
2. Group players by time preference
3. Balance by skill level within groups
4. Assign a booker to each court
5. Post assignments clearly

---

## Managing Bookers

Tell bookers to:
- Book within a few hours of assignment
- Share the link with all players (use "Share Externally" for Playtomic)
- Let you know if anyone hasn't joined or paid

---

## Handling Problems

**No-shows:**
1. Check if they gave notice
2. If not: private message asking what happened
3. If it becomes a pattern: apply the [strike system](../rules/event-rules.md)

**Last-minute cancellations:**
1. Post in group asking for a replacement
2. Check reserves or waiting list
3. If no replacement: redistribute players or cancel the court

**Weather:**
1. Check venue cancellation policy
2. Communicate clearly — games are on unless officially cancelled
3. See sport-specific rain policies

**Conflicts:**
1. Don't take sides publicly
2. Speak to people privately
3. Escalate to other organisers if serious
4. See [Community Conduct](../rules/community-conduct.md)

## Onboarding New Members

When someone new joins, send a welcome message:

```
Hi [Name], welcome to Keep Calm [Sport]!

Quick start:
1. Watch for the poll on [day]
2. Vote if you can make it
3. Check the games post for your assignment
4. Show up and have fun!

Let me know your experience level so we can match you well.
Questions? Just ask.
```

At their first session: introduce them to others, pair with a friendly regular, check in afterwards.

## When You Can't Make It

1. Tell your co-organiser ASAP
2. Hand over specific tasks for the week
3. Stay available by phone for emergencies

---

## Stepping Down

Give as much notice as possible (ideally 2-4 weeks) and:

- [ ] Document your weekly process step-by-step
- [ ] Share any login credentials securely
- [ ] Hand over venue contacts and booking procedures
- [ ] Transfer player records and strike counts
- [ ] Introduce your replacement to regular players
- [ ] Have them shadow you for 1-2 weeks
- [ ] Update WhatsApp admin rights
- [ ] Announce the change to the group

---

## Starting a New Sport

Before proposing something new, have answers for:
- What's the activity and when would it run?
- Where (venue options) and what's the cost?
- Is there demand?
- Can you commit to running it for 3-6 months?

Share your proposal with the other organisers. If approved:

- [ ] Announce in the main Keep Calm group
- [ ] Create a WhatsApp group
- [ ] Set a first session date
- [ ] Confirm venue and equipment
- [ ] Plan a beginner-friendly first session

## Informal Contributions

Not every contribution needs a title. Some of the most valuable help comes from people who:
- Help with setup and cleanup
- Bring equipment to sessions
- Help with Spanish/Catalan venue communications
- Welcome newcomers at their first session
- Take photos for social media

If you want to help in any of these ways, just let your sport organiser know.

## Getting Involved

There's no formal progression — if you attend regularly, help out, and show interest, you'll naturally get more involved. The main thing we need is reliability: people who do what they say they'll do.

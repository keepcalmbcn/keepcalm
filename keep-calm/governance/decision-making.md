# Decision Making

How decisions get made in Keep Calm. We keep it simple — the people doing the work have the authority to make decisions about their area.

## Who Decides What

### Sport Leads decide for their sport
- Player assignments, session format, timing adjustments
- Booker assignments
- Strikes for their sport (within guidelines)
- Day-to-day problem solving

**For bigger changes** (new venue, adding fees, dropping a sport): discuss with other organisers first.

### Organisers decide together for the community
- New sports or activities
- Community-wide policies and rules
- Removing members (strike 3)
- External partnerships
- Anything that affects the whole community

For significant decisions, organisers discuss and aim for consensus. If there's no consensus, majority wins. Once decided, everyone supports the decision.

## Proposing Changes

Anyone can suggest changes. The process depends on the size of the change:

**Small** (within one sport): Talk to the Sport Lead. They decide.

**Medium** (affects multiple sports or is a new policy): Write it up, share with organisers, discuss for a week or two, then decide.

**Large** (fundamental to how the community works): Written proposal, community feedback, organisers decide.

## Disagreements

1. Try to resolve directly between those involved
2. If unresolved, involve the Sport Lead
3. If still stuck, bring to the organisers as a group
4. See [Community Conduct](../rules/community-conduct.md) for conflict resolution

Once a decision is made, we move forward together. Ongoing disagreement should happen in private, not in the WhatsApp groups.

## Appeals

If you've been given a strike or removed from a group and want to appeal:
1. Contact an organiser who wasn't involved in the original decision
2. Explain your side
3. Organisers review and make a final call

## Emergency Decisions

Sometimes things can't wait — dangerous weather, someone being aggressive at a session, a last-minute venue change. Any organiser can make an emergency call. Document it and tell the other organisers afterwards.

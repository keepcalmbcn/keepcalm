# Keep Calm Running - Group Rules

Welcome to Keep Calm Running! To keep things safe and enjoyable for everyone, please follow these guidelines.

> These rules apply on top of our general WhatsApp rules:
> https://github.com/keepcalmbcn/keepcalm/blob/main/keep-calm/rules/whatsapp-rules.md

## 1. Language

English is our primary language in the chat. It's the most inclusive option when we have members from 30+ nationalities and easiest for us to moderate. Feel free to speak whatever you like while running!

## 2. Attendance

- If you say you're coming, make the effort to show up
- Others may plan their run around having company, so dropping out last minute is frustrating
- If your plans change, let the group know

## 3. Safety

- Stick to agreed routes and meeting points
- Let someone know if you need to stop or leave the group early
- Be visible - wear bright or reflective clothing for evening runs
- Bring your phone and keep emergency contacts accessible
- Stay hydrated, especially in summer
- You run at your own risk - know your limits

## 4. Respect All Paces

- Not everyone runs at the same speed, and that's fine
- Don't leave slower runners behind without checking they're OK
- If the group splits by pace, agree on a meeting point
- Faster runners - circle back and check on the group

## 5. Be Sound

- Welcome newcomers and encourage them
- Keep the atmosphere supportive, not competitive
- No personal attacks, discrimination, or drama
- Share route suggestions and tips with the group

## Admin Decisions

Admins and organisers are all volunteers. If a post gets removed or a decision is made, it's to keep things running smoothly. If you're unsure about something, just ask.

**Breaking these rules may result in a warning, and repeated violations may lead to removal from the group.**

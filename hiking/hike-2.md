Hello, for the hike at the 11.10, were going to do the iconic hike: 

https://www.komoot.com/de-DE/tour/2615969305?ref=itd&share_token=aRTm6UowllB8QbaM0YGmEZHZ1FwJoBvUXnvT7dWPnTWCY9pH2f&ref=its

The train costs 6,65 € one way. It might be included if you have a T-Mobilitat Card though. The train ride will be about 1 hour 20. 

Meeting Point: 
8.50 at Plaza España. 
We will take the train at 09.33

End Time 
It depends how fast we will walk and how many breaks we will take but I assume around 17. 

Food:
For our lunchbreak, the idea is to have a shared lunch where we will all bring some foods that we can share and then have a big variety of different foods and snacks. Everything is welcome, even some bread and dips so it doesnt have to be a big investment. For example Ill prepare a pasta salad. 

Breakfast and dinner are self organized although we could grab Dinner together in a bar later on if there is interest :)

What to bring:
- Water
- Food
- Solid Shoes
- Layered Cloth
- Rain Jacket 
- whatever else you might need 

Weather: 
If there is some light rain and a prediction for better weather, the hike will still happen.  If there is any danger whatsoever the hike will be canceled. 

Disclaimer: 
As I have never hiked the routes myself, I have to trust in the rating of komoot. Please ask yourself if you are able to hike the length of the route and the amount of altitude. And of course, hiking on your own responsibility :) 

Looking forward to it and see you soon!

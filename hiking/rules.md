# Keep Calm Hiking - Group Rules

Welcome to Keep Calm Hiking! To keep our hikes safe and enjoyable for everyone, please follow these guidelines.

> These rules apply on top of our general WhatsApp rules:
> https://github.com/keepcalmbcn/keepcalm/blob/main/keep-calm/rules/whatsapp-rules.md

## 1. Language

English is our primary language in the chat. It's the most inclusive option when we have members from 30+ nationalities and easiest for us to moderate. Feel free to speak whatever you like on the trail!

## 2. Commitment

- If you sign up for a hike, be there
- We have limited spots (25-30 people), so your place could have gone to someone else
- If you can't make it, let the group know as early as possible so someone from the waiting list can join

## 3. Be On Time

- Hikes start early and we often take trains together
- Trains don't wait, and neither can the group
- Arrive at the meeting point at the stated time, not five minutes after

## 4. Fitness Honesty

- Check the route distance and elevation before signing up
- Be honest with yourself about whether you can handle it
- If you're unsure, ask the organiser before committing
- Struggling mid-hike slows down the whole group and can create safety issues

## 5. Safety

- **Stay with the group** - don't wander off on your own
- Follow the organiser's instructions and route
- Tell the organiser if you're struggling or feeling unwell
- Bring basic first aid supplies
- Have emergency contacts accessible on your phone
- You hike at your own risk - assess your own abilities

## 6. Come Prepared

- Bring plenty of water (more than you think you need)
- Wear proper hiking shoes (not trainers or sandals)
- Dress in layers and bring a rain jacket
- Bring food for the shared lunch
- Sunscreen and a hat even if it looks cloudy

## 7. Shared Lunch

- Everyone brings something to share - it's one of the best parts
- Doesn't need to be fancy or expensive
- Pasta salad, sandwiches, fruit, snacks - anything goes
- Don't turn up empty-handed expecting to eat everyone else's food

## 8. Weather

- The organiser makes the final call on cancellations
- Don't push for a cancellation because the forecast looks a bit grey
- If it's genuinely dangerous, the hike will be called off
- Check the WhatsApp group for updates on the day

## 9. Be Sound

- Welcome newcomers and chat with people you don't know yet
- Keep the pace inclusive - check on people behind you
- Help with group photos and share them after
- No personal attacks, discrimination, or drama

## Admin Decisions

Admins and organisers are all volunteers. If a post gets removed or a decision is made, it's to keep things running smoothly. If you're unsure about something, just ask.

**Breaking these rules may result in a warning, and repeated violations may lead to removal from the group.**

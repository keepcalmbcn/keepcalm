## Repository Overview

This is a documentation and planning repository for "Keep Calm and Carry On", a not-for-profit sports community in Barcelona for English speakers. The repository contains organizational documents, planning materials, and operational guidelines for various sports activities including padel, volleyball, ping pong, tennis, badminton, hiking, and social events.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by sport/activity type, with each having its own directory:

- **padel/**: Primary focus activity with comprehensive documentation including venue information, organization processes, player guidelines, and scratch notes for planning
- **keep-calm/**: Community overview and organizational information, organized into subfolders:
  - `rules/`: Community policies (event rules, WhatsApp rules, conduct, safety, privacy, partnerships)
  - `governance/`: Decision-making, role descriptions, organiser guide, current organisers
  - `operations/`: Day-to-day logistics (schedule, onboarding, WhatsApp groups, funding)
  - `growth/`: Vision, marketing, surveys, outreach, communities
- **ping-pong/**, **tennis/**, **volleyball/**, **badminton/**, **hiking/**, **social/**: Individual sport directories with their own documentation and TODO lists

## Development Context

This is a documentation-only repository with no code compilation, testing, or linting requirements. All files are Markdown documents used for:

1. **Community Management**: Guidelines for organizers and participants
2. **Event Planning**: Operational procedures for weekly events
3. **Policy Documentation**: Rules, procedures, and best practices
4. **Communication Templates**: Standard messaging and organizational workflows

## Working with This Repository

When making changes:
- Maintain the existing directory structure organized by sport/activity
- Keep readme.md files as entry points for each section
- Use todo.md files to track tasks specific to each sport
- Place planning notes and scratch work in appropriate `scratch/` subdirectories
- Follow the existing tone and style which is community-focused and inclusive

## Common Operations

Since this is a documentation repository, common operations involve:
- Updating operational procedures based on community feedback
- Maintaining TODO lists for ongoing organizational tasks
- Adding new venue information or policy updates
- Creating planning documents for events or policy changes

No build, test, or deployment commands are needed as this repository contains only documentation files.

# Tuesday Tennis — Venues

We rotate venues depending on court availability and group size. Below are the venues we have used or considered.

---

## Primary Venue: Barcelona Pro Tennis Academy (Up Pádel & Tennis Cornellà)

This is our main home base for Tuesday Tennis.

- **Address**: Cornellà de Llobregat — [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Yri55DyC9qqTAuYw8)
- **Playtomic**: [Book here](https://playtomic.io/tenant/9ce272f4-5039-4b6a-8f07-0c206712d06a)
- **Booking window**: Up to **7 days in advance** — book Monday morning for the following Tuesday
- **Court types**: Clay and Quick (hard) courts
- **Session lengths**: 60 or 90 minutes — we prefer 90 min (enough for 2 sets)
- **Cost (doubles, 4 players)**:
  - Quick court 90 min: ~€31.20 total → ~€7.80 per person
  - Clay court 90 min: ~€39 total → ~€10 per person
- **Cancellation**: Cancel for €0.50 fee up until 10:00 on the day of the match — very fair policy
- **Facilities**: Good courts, bar/restaurant nearby, grandstand on main court
- **Travel**:
  - From Plaça Catalunya/Espanya: Take **L3** to Espanya, then **L8 or S3** to Cornellà
  - Total journey from city centre: ~40 minutes
  - Nicer than the metro — seated train journey, less crowded

**Why we use it**: Longest booking window of any venue we've found (7 days), Playtomic integration, good facilities, reasonable prices for 90 minutes.

## Eurofitness Vall d'Hebron

A closer option in the city but harder to book.

- **Address**: Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona — [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/?q=41.430347,2.146003)
- **Playtomic**: Available on the app (search Eurofitness Vall d'Hebron)
- **Booking window**: **24–48 hours in advance only** — members get priority 3 days before
- **Court type**: Clay
- **Session lengths**: 60 minutes only (can book consecutive slots)
- **Cost**: ~€10 per person (for 4 players, 60 min)
- **Travel**: Take **L3** (green line) — very easy from the city centre
- **Notes**: The venue is a maze — use the Playtomic app to check which court number you're on. Courts are near the restaurant/reception area.

**Watch out for**: Slots disappear very fast. Evening slots are extremely popular — you need to be ready to book the moment the window opens. Non-members can only book 24h before.

## C.E.M. Tennis L'Hospitalet

Used in October 2025 — decent venue, accessible from the city.

- **Address**: L'Hospitalet de Llobregat — [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cDAB7tg55sCxJheF9)
- **Playtomic**: Available
- **Session lengths**: 90 minutes
- **Cost**: ~€8–10 per person
- **Travel**: Approx. 30 minutes from Plaça Catalunya on the **L1 (red line)**
- **Notes**: Next to a highway, a bit of a walk from the metro

---

## CEM Olimpia (City Centre Option)

Mentioned by members as a more central alternative — not yet used for group sessions.

- **Location**: City centre, accessible from multiple lines
- **Booking**: Their own app — NOT on Playtomic
- **Booking window**: 48 hours in advance only (one reservation per person at a time)
- **Session lengths**: 60 or 90 minutes
- **Cost**: ~€17 (green set / hard court) or ~€22 (clay) for a full court — split between players
- **Notes**: Great location but awkward booking system for group organisation. Only allows 1 booking per person at a time.

| Vall Parc | Bookable ~6 days in advance, reasonable prices, but limited availability |

# Tuesday Tennis — FAQ

## About the Group

### What is Keep Calm Tuesday Tennis?
A weekly tennis session organised through the Keep Calm and Carry On community — a not-for-profit community for English speakers in Barcelona. We play every Tuesday evening, book courts via Playtomic, and keep things friendly, social, and inclusive.

### Who is this for?
Everyone! The group has a mix of people returning to tennis after years away, padel players trying tennis, and those who've never played properly. You don't need to be good — just willing to give it a go.

### What level is the group?
We use four levels — **Beginner, Improver, Intermediate, and Advanced** — and try to split courts by level when numbers allow. Most of the regular Tuesday players currently sit at **Improver** level: people who've played before but are getting back into it after a gap. Expect decent rallies, the occasional double fault, and good banter.

See [What level am I?](#what-level-am-i) below for full descriptions.

## The Weekly Session

### When do you play?
**Every Tuesday evening** at **19:30 or 20:30** for 90 minutes at Barcelona Pro Tennis Academy (Up Cornellà).

We meet at **Plaça Espanya** approximately **45 minutes before** court time and travel to the venue together. It's a short L8/S3 train ride from there — a good chance to get to know people before you play.

### How long is the session?
**90 minutes** is our standard. That's enough time for 2 sets of doubles. 60-minute sessions feel a bit short, especially when you've travelled to get there.

### What format do you play?
**Doubles (2v2)** for the regular Tuesday session. It's more social, better value for money, and easier to accommodate different skill levels. Singles can be organised separately through the group if there's interest.

### How much does it cost?
**~€8–10 per person** for 90 minutes at our main venue (Up Cornellà):
- Quick court: ~€7.80 per person
- Clay court: ~€10 per person

Cost is split equally between 4 players per court and paid through Playtomic.

## Joining a Session

### How do I join the weekly session?
1. Watch for the **event posted every Wednesday** — it covers the Tuesday **two weeks away**
2. Tap **Going** and drop your level in the comments (Beginner / Improver / Intermediate / Advanced)
3. Courts are booked the following week via Playtomic
4. You'll be tagged in the booking post — accept the Playtomic invite and pay your share
5. Meet at **Plaça Espanya** ~45 minutes before court time
6. Show up on Tuesday!

### I just joined the group — how do I sign up for the next session?
Watch for the event in the WhatsApp group. If no event is visible (check pinned messages), just post in the group saying you want to play and the organiser will add you.

### Can I join if I haven't played in years?
Absolutely. Most of the regular players are in exactly that position. Just be honest about your level so you get matched appropriately.

### Can I bring a friend?
Yes! The more the merrier. If you want to bring someone, just mention it in the group and they can join your court. They'll need a Playtomic account to pay their share.

### What level am I?

Pick the level that honestly describes where you are **right now** — not where you used to be or hope to be.

**Beginner**
- Never or barely played tennis
- Still learning how to rally, serve, and score
- Perfect for: starting from scratch, building confidence

**Improver**
- Played before but rusty, or just getting back into it after a long break
- Can get the ball over the net and hold a rally, but technique and consistency are works in progress
- Expect: short rallies, double faults, improving match by match
- This is where most of our regular Tuesday players currently sit

**Intermediate**
- Regular player with solid fundamentals
- Consistent serve and groundstrokes, good court awareness, understands tactics
- Can play competitive sets and hold their own in a doubles match

**Advanced**
- Competitive or ex-competitive player with strong technique
- High level of consistency, tactical play, and shot variety
- Has played at club or tournament level

Not sure? Default to **Improver** — it's easier to move up than to feel out of your depth in the wrong court.

## Booking & Playtomic

### Do I need a Playtomic account?
Yes. Our primary venue (Up Cornellà) uses Playtomic for all bookings. It's free to create an account.

**How to set up Playtomic:**
1. Download the app: [app.playtomic.com](https://app.playtomic.com/)
2. Sign up with email or social media
3. Add your name and a profile photo (helps the booker identify you)

### How does the booking work?
One person (the **booker**) books the court on Playtomic and shares the link in the WhatsApp group. Everyone else clicks the link and joins.

**How to join a shared Playtomic court:**
1. The booker posts a link like `https://app.playtomic.io/t/XXXXX`
2. Tap the link (or open it in the Playtomic app)
3. Join the match and pay your share

**How to share a court if you're the booker:**
1. Book the court on Playtomic
2. Tap the share icon (top right)
3. Tap "Share externally"
4. Post the link in the WhatsApp group and tag your 3 players

### Why do you post events two weeks in advance?
Evening slots are **very popular** and disappear fast. The event opens on **Wednesday at 18:00** and closes the following **Tuesday at 18:00**. That same Tuesday evening, after tennis, the organiser books the courts for the week after on Playtomic. Court assignments are then posted on **Wednesday**. This two-week cycle means we always book 6–7 days ahead — the sweet spot for securing 19:30 or 20:30 slots. Groups that wait until the week of the game regularly find nothing available.

### What is the cancellation policy?
At Up Cornellà: you can cancel for a €0.50 fee up until 10:00 on the day of the match. If you cancel after that window, you may still owe your share — see the [group rules](../rules.md) for details.

## Venues & Getting There

### Where do you usually play?
Our main venue is **Barcelona Pro Tennis Academy (Up Pádel & Tennis Cornellà)** in Cornellà de Llobregat.

We also use **Eurofitness Vall d'Hebron** when we want something closer to the city centre.

See [Venues](tuesday-tennis-venues.md) for full details on all venues.

### Is Cornellà far?
About 40 minutes from the city centre by public transport:
- **L3** (green line) from Plaça Catalunya or Passeig de Gràcia → Espanya
- Then **L8 or S3** from Espanya → Cornellà station (right next to the club)

It's a comfortable seated train — much nicer than a standing metro through the city. Most players find it worth it for the reliable 7-day booking window and 90-minute courts.

### Do I have to travel alone?
No! We meet as a group at **Plaça Espanya** approximately **45 minutes before** the court booking. From there everyone travels to Up Cornellà together on the L8/S3. It's a great chance to meet people before you play.

### What about Vall d'Hebron?
Much closer — **L3** (green line) stops right nearby. But courts are 60 minutes only and the booking window is just 24–48 hours, so it's harder to organise in advance for a group. When numbers are good enough for 3 courts, it becomes impractical.

## Equipment

### Do I need to bring a racket?
Bring your own if you have one. Rental rackets may be available at the venue but it's not guaranteed — always check in the group if you need to borrow one. Regular players sometimes have a spare.

### What about tennis balls?
**Important: do not use padel balls for tennis!** They're a different size and weight — trust us, we learned this the hard way. Coordinate ball supply in the group chat before the session. One or two cans is enough for a 90-minute doubles game.

### Do I need specific shoes?
Sports shoes are fine and no venue has been strict about this. Court shoes (tennis shoes) are better on clay to avoid slipping, but most players manage without them.

### What should I wear?
Any comfortable sports clothes. Clay courts can leave orange dust on shoes and clothes — worth knowing before you turn up in white.

## Equipment Shopping

### What racket should I buy as a beginner?
Start cheap and work up from there:
- **Try rental first** — a few sessions to make sure you enjoy it
- **Decathlon**: Good beginner rackets for €40–80. The lightweight options are good for starting out
- **Second-hand**: Decathlon (look for the second-hand section at L'Illa Diagonal) and local tennis shops sometimes have good used rackets
- **Tennis Point** ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4XvQaLjNUiTvg1D56)) lets you borrow rackets to trial before buying — very useful

**On racket weight:**
- Beginners: 260–280g (unstrung) is a reasonable starting range
- Strings add ~17g on average
- A 280g unstrung racket becomes ~295–300g once strung
- Lighter = easier on arm and wrist; heavier = more power but tiring over long sessions
- You can always add weight to a racket later, but you can't make it lighter — buy at the lighter end and adjust

**Old rackets with broken strings**: Check in the group — members sometimes give away old frames. At Decathlon, restringing costs €10–15, so you can end up with a decent racket cheaply.

## Weather & Cancellations

### What happens if it rains?
Indoor/covered courts are available at Up Cornellà (the quick courts are covered). Clay courts at Up are outdoor — if rain is expected, the booker may opt for the quick court instead.

Games are on unless officially cancelled by an organiser. Don't assume cancellation based on the weather forecast — wait for official word in the group.

### What if I can't make it after voting?
Let the group know **as early as possible** — give at least 5 days notice if you can. You're part of a 4-person court, so your absence affects 3 other people. Try to find a replacement rather than just announcing you're out.

See [Group Rules](../rules.md) for the full cancellation policy.

## Other Sessions & Social Play

### Can I organise a game at a different time or venue?
Yes! The Tuesday session is the official Keep Calm game, but you can post in the group anytime to find hitting partners, book a casual court at the weekend, or organise a session at a venue closer to your area. The group has members from across Barcelona with different availability — just put it out there.

### Do you play on weekends?
Not as an organised group session currently. But members do self-organise weekend games — post in the group if you're looking for weekend partners.

### Is there a beginners session?
Not yet for tennis, but watch the group for announcements. Keep Calm runs beginner padel sessions, and something similar for tennis may be organised as the group grows.

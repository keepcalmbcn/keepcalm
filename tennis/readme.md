## How Our Event System Works

We organise **two weeks in advance** to guarantee courts can be secured:

### Timeline

**Week 1 — Wednesday 18:00:**
- Event posted for the Tuesday **two weeks away**
- Tap **Going** to sign up, and include your level (Beginner / Improver / Intermediate / Advanced) in the comments

**Week 2 — Tuesday 18:00:**
- Event closes

**Week 2 — Tuesday evening (after tennis):**
- Organiser reviews the Going list and books courts on Playtomic for the following week

**Week 2 — Wednesday:**
- Court assignments posted in the group — you'll be tagged
- New event posted for the Tuesday two weeks after that

**Week 3 — Tuesday:**
- Games happen! 🎾

This two-week cycle is what lets us guarantee evening slots at a popular venue. Groups that book in the same week regularly find nothing available.

## Key Information

- **Day**: Every Tuesday evening
- **Time**: 19:30 or 20:30 (90 minutes)
- **Meet-up**: We meet at **Plaça Espanya** ~45 minutes before court time and travel together
- **Primary Venue**: [Barcelona Pro Tennis Academy (Up Cornellà)](tuesday-session/tuesday-tennis-venues.md)
- **Cost**: ~€8–10 per person (90 minutes)
- **Format**: Doubles (2v2) — social, inclusive, and makes the cost work
- **Booking app**: [Playtomic](https://app.playtomic.com/)

## Skill Levels

All levels are welcome! We use four levels to organise courts when numbers allow:

| Level | What to expect |
|-------|---------------|
| **Beginner** | Never or rarely played. Learning the basics, short rallies |
| **Improver** | Played before but rusty or just getting back into it. Can rally, the occasional double fault |
| **Intermediate** | Regular player with solid fundamentals. Good rallies, understands tactics |
| **Advanced** | Competitive player with strong technique and court awareness |

When signing up, pick the level that honestly describes where you are right now — not where you used to be or hope to be! It helps us create balanced, enjoyable courts for everyone.

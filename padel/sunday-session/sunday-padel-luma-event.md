❓ First Time Playing Padel?

No problem! Here's what you need to know:
• Padel is less physically demanding than tennis - suitable for all ages and fitness levels (8-80+)
• Smaller court with walls you can play off (like squash meets tennis)
• Underarm serving only - easier for beginners
• Try rental rackets first (€4) - if you love it, buy a beginner racket from Decathlon (€40-80)
• If you've played tennis, your skills transfer well - you'll likely start at Improver level
• Special beginner sessions run monthly - ask in the WhatsApp group!

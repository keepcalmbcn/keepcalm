Hey! I just wanted to check in personally and make sure you’re keeping well. I couldn't help but notice you haven’t been able to make it to the padel games recently and wanted to see how things are going. If there’s any reason at all (timing, venue, or even a not-so-great experience), I’d really appreciate the feedback. Either way, I’d genuinely love to see you back playing again some time soon.

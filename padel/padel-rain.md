# 🌧️ Rainy Day Padel Process

Playing padel in the rain can be tricky — but it’s also an opportunity to keep the group spirit alive.  

This process explains how we handle matches when the weather isn’t on our side.

---

## ✅ General Principles
- Matches are **still on** unless:
  - The **venue cancels** the booking on Playtomic, or
  - **All 4 players** on a specific court agree to cancel.
- **Don't jump the gun!** Weather in Barcelona can change very quickly.
  - We've had days where rain was forecast but it turned out sunny with perfect playing conditions.
  - Wait until closer to match time before making any decisions.
  - If it does rain, courts will almost certainly become unplayable and the venue will give a **full refund** to all players — so there's no risk in waiting.
- We work closely with venues to build a good relationship.
  - Cancelling all matches just because there *might* be rain is unfair to the venue.
  - This could harm our ability to block-book in the future.
- **Cancellation window:** Courts can be cancelled up to **24 hours before** the event with no penalty, so there's no harm waiting until the day before to make a decision.
  - However, as we get closer to the weekend, **indoor courts often fill up** — so switching venues last minute may not always be possible.

## 📅 Decision Timeline
A rough guide for when to think about rain decisions:

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Thursday/Friday** | Check the weekend forecast. If rain looks likely, start thinking about indoor options. |
| **Saturday morning** | Review the forecast again. If rain is still expected, the 4 players on each court can discuss backup plans. |
| **Saturday afternoon** | Final call for cancellations/changes (24-hour window). Indoor courts should be booked by now if switching. |
| **Sunday morning** | If weather is uncertain, wait and see. The venue will cancel and refund if courts become unplayable. |

## 🌈 Keeping Perspective
- Missing one or two weeks of padel a year due to weather is **not a big deal**.
- What matters most is staying **positive and consistent** to keep the club alive and thriving.
- Bad weather weeks are temporary — our community spirit is what lasts.

## 💬 Communication Rules
- **Keep WhatsApp chat minimal.**  
  - Important updates need to be clear and easy to find.  
  - Use **private messages** if possible instead of over utilising the group chat.
- **No negativity.**  
  - Don’t keep talking about the rain or try to persuade others to cancel.  
  - Refrain from ringing the venue, or cancelling through the app.  
- **Dropouts** (even for rain) are treated as **normal dropouts**.  
  - They will receive a strike and be added to the **Wall of Shame**.  
- Do **not** repeatedly ask, “Are we playing?” — if it rains, assume the match is on unless cancelled officially via playtomic.

## 🍻 Social Spirit
Remember: this is a **social group, not just padel**.  
- If the courts close or a game is cancelled, why not grab a drink or some food at the bar?  
- Keep the good vibes going, rain or shine.  

---

## 🏟️ Venue Policy
- If the venue decides the weather/courts are unsafe, games will be cancelled.
- You will receive a **full refund** in this case.

## 🏠 Preferred Indoor Venues
If outdoor courts are unavailable due to weather, we may look to move to one of these indoor venues.

**Important:** Indoor backup courts should be organised by the **4 players** (3 players + 1 booker) on each court — not by the main organiser. Coordinate with your group and book early if rain looks likely.

Due to the size of the group, please try to organise amongst yourselves and avoid overwhelming the organisers with individual questions. Check this document, discuss with your court group, and only escalate to the organiser if absolutely necessary.

## 🌦️ Playing in Light Rain
If matches continue in drizzle or after rain:  
- **Take care of your racket.** Water isn’t good for it.  
- **Watch your footing.** Courts may be slippery.  
- **Use spare/rubbish balls.** The organiser usually has a bag full for wet conditions.

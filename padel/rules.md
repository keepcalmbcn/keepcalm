# Keep Calm Padel - Group Rules

Welcome to Keep Calm Padel! To keep things fair and fun for everyone, please follow these guidelines.

> These rules apply on top of our general WhatsApp rules:
> https://github.com/keepcalmbcn/keepcalm/blob/main/keep-calm/rules/whatsapp-rules.md

## 1. Language

English is our primary language in the chat. It's the most inclusive option when we have members from 30+ nationalities and easiest for us to moderate. Feel free to speak whatever you like on court!

## 2. Use the Right Group

- **Scheduling groups** (Sunday, Saturday, Weekday) are for polls, game organisation, and logistics only
- **Level groups** (Beginner, Improver, Intermediate, Advanced) are for level-specific coordination
- **Padel General** is for chat, questions, tips, and general padel conversation - not for posting games
- Keep things in the right place so important messages don't get lost

## 3. Posting Games

If you're looking for players to fill a game:
- **Post it in the level group that matches the game** (e.g. a beginner game goes in Beginners, an intermediate game goes in Intermediate)
- **Do not post games in Padel General** - that group is for chat and conversation, not recruitment
- **Do not cross-post the same game across multiple level groups** - pick the one that matches
- **Only post the same game once every 48 hours** - if you didn't fill it, you can repost after 48 hours, but don't keep spamming it
- If a game has a mix of levels, post it in the group that best fits the majority of players

## 4. Coaching

- Do not advertise or set up padel coaching sessions in any of the groups
- If someone asks for coaching recommendations, you're welcome to recommend a certified padel instructor or coach
- Keep Calm is not a platform for selling coaching services, even if you mean well
- If you are a coach and want to offer something to the community, speak to an admin first

## 5. Polls and Commitment

- Only vote in a poll if you genuinely plan to play
- Once you vote, consider yourself committed to that session
- We organise games based on poll numbers, so dropping out causes problems for everyone

## 6. Cancellations

- Give at least **3 days notice** if you can't make it
- **Post in the group** so others can see
- **Help find a replacement** - you're part of a 4-person court, so your absence affects 3 other people. It's your responsibility to try to fill your spot, not just announce you're out
- Cancelling with less than 3 days notice without finding a replacement will result in a strike
- No-shows without any notice will result in a strike
- **3 strikes and you will likely be removed from the community**
- Genuine emergencies happen and we understand that, but a pattern of late cancellations won't be tolerated

## 7. Payment

- Pay your share through Playtomic or as instructed by the booker
- If you cancel late (less than 3 days), you may still owe your share
- Don't leave other players to cover your cost

## 8. Booking Responsibilities

If you're assigned as the booker for a court:
- Book the court promptly after games are posted
- Share the Playtomic link with your court using "Share Externally"
- Tag your players so they see it
- Communicate any issues quickly

## 9. Skill Levels

- Be honest about your level when joining groups
- Levels are based on Playtomic scores (Beginner, 0-1, 1-2, 2+)
- It's better to start at a lower level and work your way up
- Organisers may move you to a more suitable level if needed

## 10. Weather

- Games are on unless officially cancelled by an organiser
- Don't ring the venue directly about cancellations
- Don't cancel your booking through the app yourself
- Don't try to convince others to cancel
- Trust the organisers and the rain policy

## 11. Venue Respect

- Be respectful to venue staff
- Follow the venue's rules
- Look after the facilities
- Good relationships with venues help us keep getting courts

## 12. Be Sound

- Welcome newcomers and help them find their feet
- Keep things friendly on and off the court
- No personal attacks, discrimination, or drama
- One clear message beats ten one-word messages

## Admin Decisions

Admins and organisers are all volunteers. If a post gets removed or a decision is made, it's to keep things running smoothly. If you're unsure about something, just ask.

**Breaking these rules may result in a warning, and repeated violations may lead to removal from the group.**

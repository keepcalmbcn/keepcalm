I really appreciate you volunteering today, and I genuinely value your input. I wanted to share a bit more context around some of the decisions, as I know a few things can feel unusual compared to regular padel.

I’ve now run five of these beginner sessions, and each one has grown in size and complexity. With 80+ sign-ups this time, some choices may look a little different — but they come from experience and from trying to think about the long-term success of both the community and our relationships with venues.

A few things that may help explain the approach:

**Dropouts are common (80+ people instead of 56)** — we’ve already had 28 people drop out. That’s why we overbook and why we run with five/six players per court instead of four. Courts cost around €25 each and still need to be paid for even if fewer people show up, so this helps protect the session from last-minute gaps/costs.

**This isn’t regular padel (4 people on court)** — it’s an introduction to the sport *and* to the community. The main goal is to help new players feel comfortable, connected, and keen to come back, rather than focusing on strict 4-on-4 play. That social side is really important for building something sustainable.

**Thinking longer term (filling up last minute spots)** — these sessions aren’t just about today. They’re about gradually growing the community and being a reliable, trusted partner for venues. Aurial displaced another club for us, so filling courts and running smooth sessions matters if we want to keep booking there in the future (and they’re also great for racket rentals).

**On payments (just take patement before)** — we can’t take money upfront, as we’re not a business or a sports association. Asking players to pay the venue directly adds another hurdle for beginners, which we’re trying to avoid at this stage.

**On leading the session and communication (just make changes/communication there)** — running these sessions can be challenging, especially with lots of players being rotated and guided at once. Because beginners can already feel a bit overwhelmed, clear and calm communication really matters. Well-meant public comments can sometimes add confusion or pressure, even unintentionally.

**On feedback timing** — on the day itself, my focus has to be on logistics. If something’s been noted, it’s noted. Revisiting it publicly can add stress without much benefit. I’d really appreciate saving non-urgent feedback for after the session, when we can talk it through properly.

For today, I’m just asking for a bit of trust in my judgment. If something doesn’t feel right, a private message is always welcome — it helps keep the group atmosphere positive and supportive for the beginners.

After the session, I’d really like to do a proper debrief and hear your thoughts on what worked and what didn’t. Your experience is valuable, and I do want your input — just in the right moment.

Thanks again for being here and for helping make this work. I really appreciate it.

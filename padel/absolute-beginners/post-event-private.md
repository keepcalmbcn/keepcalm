Hey team! 🎾

What an incredible day! Thank you SO much to each and every one of you for making today's *Absolute Beginners Padel Session* such a success!

🙏 *THANK YOU COURT LEADERS*
Each of you took on a court of 4 or 5 complete beginners and guided them through their first padel experience - that's no small task! You gave up your time to help complete strangers learn a new sport, and that's what makes this community special. None of this happens without you.

📸 *THANK YOU JEFF*
A huge shout-out to Jeff for capturing the day on camera! Your photos help us share the experience and show what Keep Calm is all about. We really appreciate you being there!

🌟 *THANK YOU JESS*
A huge shout-out to Jess for being everywhere at once! From meet and greet, to rallying people for the group photo, collecting balls, and keeping everyone informed - you helped keep the whole event running smoothly and managed to squeeze in a glass of wine. We really appreciate you being there!

💬 *WE WANT YOUR FEEDBACK*

Hey everyone! 🎾

What an incredible day! Thank you SO much to everyone who came to our *Absolute Beginners Padel Session* today!

🙏 *A HUGE thank you to our amazing volunteers* who gave up their time to lead courts, meet and greet, help with rackets, and make sure everyone had a great experience. We couldn't have done it without you!

We hope you had fun learning the basics and meeting new people in the community! If things felt a bit hectic at times, we apologise - running a session with so many people is always a challenge, but your patience and positive attitude made it work!

# Absolute Beginners Padel Session Guide

## Overview
- **Venue**: Aurial Pàdel Cornellà by Marta Marrero
- **Frequency**: Aim to run one beginner session per month (ideally first week of month)
- **Timing**: Leave a 30-60 minute break between beginner session and regular padel session
- **Equipment**: 2 balls per player per court (the organiser will aim to bring these or players can bring their own)

## Pre-Event Setup

### Registration Form (Google Form/Event Platform)
Ask participants:
- Do they have a racket or will they need to borrow one?
- Do they have experience in padel/tennis or other sports?
- Is there another player they want to play with (partner)?

**Note**: Racket rental is a special deal at 2 euros instead of 4 - rent on the day at reception, not through Playtomic.

### Volunteer Coordination
- Send messages to the group to gather volunteers for organization
- Send messages to the intermediate and advanced players to come help.
- Find one volunteer leader per court to teach/help
- Other volunteers can just meet/greet, talk about our padel, talk about our community or tell people where toilets are etc.
- Give each leader a teaching plan of things to cover (hitting/serving etc)
- Instruct leaders to get players into the WhatsApp group
- Other volunteer jobs (Take pictures/Help with rackets/Meet greet and point towards)

### Pre-Event Communications
- Send welcome email with WhatsApp link to all attendees
